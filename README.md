# stock_python

I collected my investing group manually at first and wasted more than 1 hour per day. Because it's a boring routine, thus I learn how to save time through Python.

Use "Beautiful Soup" to get a list of stocks, use "yfinance" to get historical data, apply some strategies and pick up my final collection afterwards.
